##Project Description##

We implemented the concept of RSA Cryptography in our project. The program will take any string input from the user and then will encrypt the string and then again will decrypt the string back. Euler's Theorem is used to implement this concept.

##Discrete Maths Concepts Used##

We used Euler's Theorem to implement this concept. In the class we studied the whole topic of cryptography and the theorem where we first find large prime numbers p and q. From p and q we will find totient n from which public and private keys will be formed.

##Problems Faced##

The biggest and only problem was to implement those complicated equations in programming. These problems were solved by watching youtube videos and finding samples on github.
